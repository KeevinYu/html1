    <h1 style="color:#ffffff;"> <center>The Mission of GymBro Supps </center> </h1><!--Just testing out colors:)-->
    <p> <style="color:#ffffff;"> <center>The Mission of GymBro Supps is to provide an online shopping center for suppliments and apparrel for Gym Bros around the world.</center></p>
    <h1> <center>This is one of the Websites I am modeling my site after, click on the image for a link to their website! </center> </p>

    <center> <img src="images/Hosstile.jpg" alt="this is a picture of the website" width="400" height="400"/> </center>
 </a>
    <!-- the reason why I am choosing this website to model mine after is because its basically exactly how I want mine to look. Its very simply and orginized in the layout, It has both apparrel and suppliments in their store. I really enjoy also the contrast of colors within the website and how everything pops on the black and white background-->
    <h1> <center> Goals for the website </center> </h1>
    <p> <center> Goals for this site would be to provide a quality product, to make the website easy to use and navigate through, and also to be very organized in its appearance and obvious and how to get around and what you're clicking on and where its going to take you. </center> </p>
    <h1> <center> Content Areas </center> </h1>
    <p> <center> The number of content areas would be things such as, a homepage with new releases for clothes and suppliments, then different pages for different types of clothing such as t shirts, shorts, pants, etc. Different pages for suppliments, reviews. I estimate making about 5-6 different Html pages once this website is completed.</center></p>
    <!--Home page to display new/popular items, Clothing page to display our clothing, Suppliment Page to display suppliments, About us page/contact us, Reviews page-->
    <h1> <center> Targeted Audience </center> </h1>
    <p> <center> The target audience is going to be Mainly for people that go to the gym but not limited to them. Anyone who likes how the apparrell looks or takes suppliments could come to the website as well. </center> </p>
